One of the most exhilarating observations of physics and mathematics for me, comes from understanding the concept of [nonlinearity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system). i.e. inputs don't necessarily need to be proportionate to outputs. The understanding that in a non-linear system, increasing the "right inputs" are far more important than "increased average inputs".

The notion of non-linearity is not a new observation, however what really fascinates me is the degree to which we **don't** think in an non-linear fashion. The world around us is full of nonlinear relationships, however we tend to think and behave linearly. In a non-linear world doing the "right work" is what makes the difference. A nice truism that attests to this fact says "doing what is not important very well doesn't make it important".

I believe that the importance of understanding nonlinearity goes beyond our material success and up to the way we feel. One example that particularly makes me think about nonlinearity is the [impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). A lot of us have had accomplishments that we didn't expect to have or we don't feel we deserve. I believe that without understanding the concept of nonlinearity and the importance of the "right efforts"  as opposed to "increased average effort", we might experience the impostor syndrome in our accomplishments.
