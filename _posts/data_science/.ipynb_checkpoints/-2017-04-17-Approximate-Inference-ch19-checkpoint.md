- A model usually consists of two sets of visible and hidden variables. Inference is the problem of computing $$p(h|v)$$ or taking an expectation on it. This is usually necessary for maximum likelihood learning. 

- In some graphical models with a particular structure like RBM and pPCA, where there is only a single hidden layer, inference is easy meaning that $$p(h|v)$$ can be calculated by multiplying the visible variables by the weight matrix. 

- Intractable inference (too computationally hard to calculate, omits the gains of having a probabilistic graphical model) in DL usually arises from interaction between latent variables in a structured graphical model. It may be due to direct interactions between hidden variables in an undirected graph (which produces large cliques of latent vars) or the "explaining away" effect in directed graphs. 

- We bypass the intractable exact calculation of the normalizer by approximating the partition function as explained in chapter 18. An alternative approach to solving the inference problem involves direct approximation of the posterior (i.e. variational inference). We start with the definition of the data distribution $$p(x)=\int_z p(x,z)$$ and introduce a family of distributions, $$q$$, on hidden variables to act as an approximation for the posterior. 
- We write down the ELBO using the concavity of the log function. Using the Jensen's inequality, we replace the equality with an inequality $$ \log p(x) > E_q[log p(x, Z)] − E_q[log q(Z)]$$ and choose a family of variational distributions such that the expectations are computable. For example, in mean field variational inference, we assume that each variable is independent and that the variational family factorizes and expectations are computable. In real posteriors however, variables are not independent. These dependencies are often what makes the posterior difficult to work with.

- Then, we maximize the ELBO to find the parameters that give as tight a bound as possible on the marginal probability of x. By maximizing the lower bound (ELBO), we effectively bypass the calculation of the normalizer for the computation of the posterior. 

- Different forms of approximate inference use different approximate optimization methods to find the best $$q$$. We can make the optimization procedure less expensive by restricting the family of distributions $$q$$ or by using an imperfect optimization procedure that may not completely maximize the ELBO but merely increase it by a significant amount. Also the divergence metric we use to measure the distance between an initial distribution and the desired distribution is important. For example, KL divergence connects to variational inference while other divergences connect to other approximate inference techniques like belief propagation, expectation propagation, etc. 

- The ELBO is determined from introducing a variational distribution $$q$$, on lower bound on the marginal log likelihood, i.e. $$\log \ p(x)=\log \int_z p(x,z) * \frac{q(z|x)}{q(z|x)}$$. We use the log-likelihood to be able to use the concavity of the $$\log$$ function and employ Jensen's inequality to move the $$\log$$ inside the integral i.e. $$\log \ p(x) > \int_z \log\ (p(x,z) * \frac{q(z|x)}{q(z|x)})$$ and then use the definition of expectation on $$q$$ (the nominator $$q$$ goes into the definition of the expectation on $$q$$ to write that as the ELBO) $$\log \ p(x) > ELBO(z) = E_q [- \log\ q(z|x) + \log \ p(x,z)]$$. The difference between the ELBO and the marginal $$p(x)$$ which converts the inequality to an equality is the distance between the real posterior and the approximate posterior i.e. $$KL[q(z|x)\ | \ p(z|x)]$$. Or alternatively, the distance between the ELBO and the KL term is the log normalizer $$p(x)$$. Replace the $$p(z|x)$$ with Bayesian formula to see how. 

- Note that in the above derivation of the ELBO, the first term is the entropy of the variational posterior and second term is log of joint distribution. However we usually write joint distribution as $$p(x,z)=p(x|z)p(z)$$ to rewrite the ELBO as $$ E_q[\log\ p(x|z)+KL(q(z|x)\ | \ p(z))]$$. This derivation is much closer to the typical machine learning literature in deep networks. The first term is log likelihood (i.e. reconstruction cost) while the second term is KL divergence between the prior and the posterior (i.e a regularization term that won't allow posterior to deviate much from the prior). Also note that if we only use the first term as our cost function, the learning with correspond to maximum likelihood learning that does not include regularization and might over fit.

- Now that we have defined a loss function (ELBO), we need the gradient of the loss function, $$\delta E_q[-\log q(z \vert x)+p(x,z)]$$ to be able to use it for optimization with SGD. The gradient isn't easy to derive analytically but we can estimate it using MCMC to directly sample from $$q(z \vert x)$$ and estimate the gradient. This approach generally exhibits large variance since MCMC might sample from rare values. This is where the re-parameterization trick comes in and reduces the variance by decoupling the random and deterministic parts of the model and making it differentiable. 

## Expectation Maximization (EM)

- EM is not an approach to approximate inference, but rather an approach to learning that uses an approximate posterior. EM maximizes the ELBO to find parameters for latent variable models by introducing an approximate posterior $$q$$. 
- Algorithmically, EM repeatedly uses an estimate of parameters as an approximate posterior with which it calculates an update (by maximizing ELBO w.r.t. the parameters); Then it uses the update to calculate new estimates for parameters:

-  Formally, EM consists of two steps that are repeated till convergence:
    +  Expectation step: we set the approximate posterior $$q$$ to the value of the posterior $$p$$ at that beginning of that step i.e. $$q= p(h \vert x;\theta^0)$$. 
    +  Maximization step: We maximize the ELBO with respect to parameters using an optimization algorithm (for example calculate gradient and use SGD update rule). 
    +  Repeat!

- This is similar to coordinate ascent for maximizing the ELBO; in the expectation step we maximize the ELBO w.r.t. $$q$$ using averages as an approximation of the expectation. Then we fix $$q$$ and  maximize the ELBO w.r.t. parameters. Repeat!

- SGD on latent variable model can be seen as a special case of EM where the maximization step is taking a single gradient step. Other optimization algorithms such as the Newton method can take a larger M step all the way to to global maximum. 

- Even though the E-step involves exact inference, we can think of the EM  as using approximate inference in some sense. Specifically, the M-step assumes that the same value of $$q$$ can be used for all values of parameters. This will introduce a gap between the ELBO and the true posterior as the M-step moves further and further away from the value initial value of parameters used in the E-step. Fortunately, the E-step reduces the gap to zero again as we enter the loop for the next time.

- One insight of EM is that there is the basic structure of the learning process, in which we update the model parameters to improve the likelihood of a completed dataset, where all missing variables have their values provided by an estimate of the posterior distribution. This particular insight is not unique to the EM algorithm. For example, using gradient descent to maximize the log-likelihood also has this same property; the log-likelihood gradient computations require taking expectations with respect to the posterior distribution over the hidden units.

- Another insight of the EM algorithms is that we can continue to use the one value of $$q$$ even after an update to obtain larger M steps.

## Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference 
- MAP inference estimates the most likely value of missing values as point estimates instead of calculating their distributions. We can derive MAP estimate from the ELBO, if we restrict the approximate posterior family $$q$$ to a point (Dirac) distribution $$q~\delta(h-\mu)$$.
- MAP inference is commonly used in DL as a learning method and a feature extractor mostly in sparse coding models. In sparse coding, the inference problem faces an explaining away situation that limits the factorization of the posterior. This makes the inference intractable. MAP inference is used to overcome that. 

## Variational Inference

-  Inference can be viewed as maximizing the ELBO with respect to $$q$$, and learning can be viewed as maximizing the ELBO with respect to parameters.

- The core idea behind variational learning is that we maximize the ELBO over a restricted family of distributions such that the expectation $$E_q[log p(x, z)]$$ in the ELBO is computable. This way we are basically replacing the real posterior with an approximation. A typical way to do this is to use a factorized $$q$$ (for example mean field for iid latents or a structured graph for an LDS).

- The beauty of the variational approach is that we do not need to specify a specific parametric form for $$q$$. We specify how it should factorize, but then the optimization problem determines the optimal probability distribution within those factorization constraints. For continuous latent variables, this means that we use a branch of mathematics called calculus of variations to perform optimization over a space of functions, and actually determine which function should be used to represent $$q$$.

- Maximizing the ELBO is equivalent to minimizing the $$KL[q|p]$$. In maximum likelihood learning, we minimize KL(p_data|p_model) which is the opposite direction. KL[q|p] is chosen for computational reasons however the chosen direction has implication:

- It's useful to think about the distance measure we talked about. KL-divergence measures a sort of distance between two distributions but it's not a true distance since it's not symmetric  $$KL(P|Q) = E_P[\log\ P(x) − \log\ Q(x)]$$. So which distance direction we choose to minimize has consequences. For example, in minimizing $$KL(p|q)$$, we select a $$q$$ that has high probability where $$p$$ has high probability so when $$p$$ has multiple modes, $$q$$ chooses to blur the modes together, in order to put high probability mass on all of them. 

On the other hand, in minimizing $$KL(q \vert p)$$, we select a $$q$$ that has low probability where $$p$$ has low probability. When $$p$$ has multiple modes that are sufficiently widely separated, the KL divergence is minimized by choosing a single mode (mode collapsing), in order to avoid putting probability mass in the low-probability areas between modes of $$p$$. In VAEs we actually minimize $$KL(q \vert p)$$ so mode collapsing is a common problem. Additionally, due to the complexity of true distributions we also see blurring problem. These two cases are illustrated in the following figure from the [deep learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/).

### Discrete Latent Variables

- In the discrete case, we define $$q$$ such that each of its factors are just defined by a lookup table over discrete states. Along with a factorization assumption (e.g. mean field), we can represent the variational distribution $$q$$ and optimize its parameters. Because this optimization must occur in the inner loop of a learning algorithm,it must be very fast.

- a fast optimization algorithm is to find the fixed point (extrema) of the gradient of loss function using fixed point iteration. Fixed point iteration finds the fixed point of a function $$f(x)=0$$, by just formulating it as $$x=g(x)$$ and iterating on it. 

- variational inference for binary sparse coding is a complete example (study later).

### Calculus of Variation
- Calculus of variation enables us to apply linear algebra and multivariate calculus to the space of functions. For example, when we want to find the probability density function of some random variables, we want to optimize an objective to give us a function and not just an optimal point. 

- In regular calculus the objective is a function and solution is a point where the function takes an optimal value. In variational calculus, the objective is a function of functions and the solution is a function where the objective takes the optimal value. 

- A function of functions is called a functional J[f]. We can apply much of the tools we have for functions to functionals. For example, we can take partial derivative of a functional w.r.t. the individual values of the functions i.e. $$\frac{\delta J}{\delta f(x)}$$

- Derivate of a functional is similar to partial derivative of a function with an infinite dimension argument.  Individual values of the functions constitute the infinite dimension vector of arguments. 

- To optimize a function with respect to a vector, we take the gradient of the function with respect to the vector and solve for the point where every element of the gradient is equal to zero. Likewise, we can optimize a functional by solving for the function where the functional derivative at every point is equal to zero.

- An example problem: finding a probability density function with a cetrain mean and variance for which the entropy is maximum. We form the Lagrangian functional by imposing constraints that the density function be integrated to one, mean and variance be fixed. We calculate the partial derivative of the functional w.r.t. the density function $$p(x)$$ and equal to zero. We obtain the density function to be of exponential type and by choosing certain values for the lagrange multipliers we arrive at the Normal distribution as the maximum entropy distribution among all possible density functions!

### Continuous Latent Variables (modern Variation inference)
- In grapical models inference, we need to use variational calculus to maximize the ELBO functional (a function of possible density functions).

- Using a mean-field (factorized graph) assumption for the density function, we can maximize the ELBO using variational calculus. We are not making any assumptions about the components of the factorized graph to be of the exponential family but by only assuming a mean-field factorization for the graphical model we arrive at a solution for the ELBO functional in the form of the exponential family. 

- Therefore, this is why we throw the exponential family of distributions at the posterior and learn the parameters in variational inference.

- [Rezende, Mohammed 2016] Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. In Normalizing flows a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations

### Interactions between Learning and Inference
- Using approximate inference (ways to deal with the intractable partition function) as part of a learning algorithm (parameter estimation) has side effects. The training algorithm tends to adapt the model in a way that makes the approximating assumptions underlying the approximate inference algorithm become more true.
- For example, If we train the model with a unimodal approximate posterior, we will obtain a model with a true posterior $$p(z|x)$$ that is far closer to unimodal than we would have obtained by training the model with exact inference.

## Learned approximate inference
- Inference can be thought of as an optimization problem (through ELBO). we can think of the optimization process as a function f that maps an input to an approximate distribution. We can approximate it with a neural network that implements an approximation. 
- For example, the inference network in a VAE infers the posterior from a data point.
