1. Get on LinkedIn
Send twenty connection requests to data scientists.
Message a connection and tell them you're looking for a data science position.
Share an article from datatau.com that taught you something.
2. Get on GlassDoor
Read three data scientist job descriptions. Note skills you need to build.
Apply for a data scientist position, whether you are qualified for it or not.
3. Build a skill
Pick a skill and use it to build a small demo or tutorial. Don’t spend more than ten hours on it.
Put your demo/tutorial online. Add the skill to your LinkedIn profile and add a link to it in the Projects section.
4. Interview
Only answer recruiters who know your name.
Take every interview you can. Note skills you need to build.
5. Decline the offer
6. Go to step one

## Interview framework

-   Write actual code that works, not pseudocode
-   Opt for a mainstream programming language (Java, C/C++, Python, JavaScript)
-   Practice coding on a whiteboard
-   Practice coding on paper (preferably blank, without lines)
-   Write clean code:
    -   Use good names (classes/functions/variables)
    -   Show good modularity (classes/functions)
    -   Leave time for error checking and edge cases, even better to start with them (or add `TODO`s for yourself)
    -   If you're cutting corners state that out loud, and say what you would do if you had more time (e.g., in Java: *I'm using public fields for brevity here, but would otherwise use getters/setters*)
-   Use proper algorithms and data structures and make sure to state Big-O for all of them
-   When first approaching a problem:
    -   Make sure you understand the task. Repeat it to show that to yourself and the interviewer
    -   Don't begin by writing code immediately!
    -   Ask questions about the task, inputs, assumptions, formats; most questions are *under specified* on purpose
    -   Assume nothing! Or state you're doing so
    -   Think out loud, share what you're thinking (brainstorm)
    -   Try to show how you think thru the issue
    -   Silence isn't good, long ones are *bad*
    -   Make sure the interviewer has a clear idea of how you're doing (so they can help!)
    -   Start with a simple example, later add detailed ones
    -   Clarify the function signature of the problem early on. This will help focus your thoughts, and possibly invite subtle guidance from your interviewer
    -   Start with a *simple* inefficient solution (simple != easy)
    -   Improve the inefficient one
    -   Break down the problem to parts
-   Questions are in-depth, usually don't have an *easy* solution (can be simple tho)
-   Think about input validation, constraints
-   Think about test cases, run thru them to make sure code is correct (but don't assume it's correct, really check as if someone else wrote it)
-   If the interviewer gave examples/hints *use them*
-   When done ask if you can refine the code, improving variable names, extracting other methods, etc.
-   Leave out trivial parts as functions that you need to implement, and only go back to those if you have time
-   Upon completion of first solution, either try to improve it, or try to come up with a different solution that is better (e.g.: recursion vs. imperative code)
-   Assumptions might now change, and so the solution needs to be adapted
-   Glossing over standard APIs if you're not sure is OK, make sure you state that and give a reasonable API to work with


## Google Brain event:

Kevin Swersky: Generative models, BNNs, RL, few shot learning (meta learning, learning to learn)


Nick Frosst: Explainable models by building trees. Capsules


What does Google look for?
how a candidate thinks, leadership skills , role-related knowledge, Googlyness! (help, collaborate, open thoughts, innovative, pleasure to work with). 

AI residency:
- classif SWE inerview
- applied knowledge -> publications, projects, open source,  etc (explain these in your application)
- apply earlier. Rolling basis!???
- Eric Langlua / brain resident
