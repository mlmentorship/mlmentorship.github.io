### Stream 1 (Starting out in ML)

This stream is suitable for participant that do not have any ML experience and are interested in a curriculum for self-learning. The following curriculum along with a support group of peers going through the same journey will prepare participants for stream two.

You donâ€™t need to know everything about everything. At the beginning, focus on learning a few things really well.

- Machine learning basics: how to formulate a machine learning problem
    + [Introduction](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html), and [Chapter 5](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html) of the deep learning book 
        + *Note*: if you need a refresher on [Linear Algebra](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html),  [probability theory](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html), and [numerical computation](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html), chapters 2-4 in the deep learning book are a great resource. 
    + [optional] [Chapter 1](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) of Hands-on machine learning book
- Learn theory of 5 basic algorithms, how to evaluate them and how to use them in practice (sklearn):
    - regression:
        - Linear regression 
    - Clustering:
        - K-means clustering
    - classification:
        - logistic regression
        - SVMs
        - Random forests
- Model evaluation
    - Cross-validation, over-fitting, 
    - accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, ROC curve, loss functions
- Project 1 [Kaggle]
    - study problem formulation
    - follow others' solutions with various algorithms
    - replicate existing solutions and understand various aspects of data preparation and modeling


## Guidance on picking Projects 
- project 1 (Stream 1):
    - should be doable in a span of a week (estimated 40-60 hours),
    - focus is on learning by example, how a data problem is formulated, how others solved the problem.
        - Test: the main question to be able to answer everywhere is "WHY"?
    - What business problem does solving this problem tries to meet? What is the value of the project if solved?
        - Test: Think about the business, is this problem worth solving?
    - Understand the data, how to pre-process, explore, normalize similar datasets, why? and what tools are used?
        - Test: Can you do the data preparation on a similar dataset?]
    - why have a specific algorithm been used to model the dataset? How were the hyper-parameters chosen?
        - Test: Can you compare the algorithms, what are pros and cons?
        - Test: Can you apply the algorithms you studied on a different but similar problem?
    - How is each solution evaluated? what is the evaluation metric?
        - Test: Why does that metric make sense? Can you justify it? what are the alternatives?
        - Test: How did you make sure the model didn't overfit? Can you justify why the solution is correct?
    - Can you write about the problem, and the solutions you studied, and the tools you used in a blog post?
        - Test: Find gaps in your knowledge while writing you blog post.
        - Test: what did you learn? What did you find very useful? What are the caveats?
