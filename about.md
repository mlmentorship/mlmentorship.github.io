## ML Mentorship program

Machine learning mentorship program and this blog have been established in order to help people that are trying to enter machine learning / data science from STEM fields. The aim of ML mentorship is to provide guidance in what to focus on in terms of learning,  direct participants' efforts toward projects with more return on invested time, and advise on ML problem formulation and problem solving. The program is structured in a funnel of three streams listed below all of which will be provided with support from a community of peers and a advisorship from a mentor. [More details comming soon]

### Stream 1 (Starting out in ML)

This stream is suitable for participant that do not have any ML experience and are interested in a curriculum for self-learning. The following curriculum along with a support group of peers going through the same journey will prepare participants for stream two.

You donâ€™t need to know everything about everything. At the beginning, focus on learning a few things really well.

- Machine learning basics: how to formulate a machine learning problem
    + [Introduction](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html), and [Chapter 5](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html) of the deep learning book 
        + *Note*: if you need a refresher on [Linear Algebra](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html),  [probability theory](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html), and [numerical computation](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html), chapters 2-4 in the deep learning book are a great resource. 
    + [optional] [Chapter 1](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) of Hands-on machine learning book
- Learn theory of 5 basic algorithms, how to evaluate them and how to use them in practice (sklearn):
    - regression:
        - Linear regression 
    - Clustering:
        - K-means clustering
    - classification:
        - logistic regression
        - SVMs
        - Random forests
- Model evaluation
    - Cross-validation, over-fitting, 
    - accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, ROC curve, loss functions
- Project 1 [Kaggle]
    - study problem formulation
    - follow others' solutions with various algorithms
    - replicate existing solutions and understand various aspects of data preparation and modelling

### Stream 2 (Getting first ML job)
In stream two, the most important thing for job seekers is obtaining experience in doing projects that would be similar to what a Data scientist/ML engineer will do on the job. This will be achieved through doing multiple individual projects to gain experience with various data modalities and algorithms. The capstone group projects' goal is to simulate the actual work that you'll do as a data scientist/ML engineer in your actual job.
- Project 2 [Kaggle]
    - replicate others existing solutions
    - provide 1 additional solution to the problem
- Project 3 [Kaggle]
    - replicate others existing solutions
    - provide 1 additional solution to the problem
- Project 4 [Capstone group project]
    - ML problem formulation
    - data collection / preparation
    - modelling
    - team work

- Interview prep

### Stream 3 ( ML Career progress)
This stream is mostly relevant to people that are currently in a ML/DS role and are seeking ways to advance their technical careers. This can be achieved by learning more advanced ML topics, replicating state of the art machine learning papers, and building on top of these works to make new contribution to the field.  
- Advanced ML topics
    - learn basics of a sub-field (e.g. NLP)
- Advanced project 1 [replicating a paper from github code]
    - replicate the building of baselines methodologies
    - replicate the papers' proposed method and understand insights, details of implementation, and the pros and cons.
- Advanced project 2 [build on top of project Advanced project 1]
    - read and review relevant literature
    - list a set of ideas to improve upon the paper from advanced project 1
    - design a set of experiments
    - implement and experiment with a subset ideas
    - write up the project in the form of a conference paper

- Interview prep
