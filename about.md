Machine learning mentorship program and this blog have been established to help people that are trying to enter machine learning / data science from STEM fields. The aim of ML mentorship is to provide guidance in terms of what to focus in the learning path, direct participants’ efforts toward projects with more return on invested time, and advice on ML problem formulation and solving. The ultimate goal is for participants to find a ML/DS related job in the industry and advance their careers. The program is structured in three streams listed below, all of which will be provided with support from a community of peers and advisorship from a mentor [More details comming soon]. Additionally, I’ll also invite DS/ML professionals in my network to share their experience with you. Here's a video from our first introduction session:

##### Program focus on writing and sharing

Writing is consistently a very big part of the process of learning, finding a job, and career growth especially in ML/DS as it can solidify your learnings, and get visibility to your work. I encourage everyone in the program to take personal notes in your learning journey. These notes will become handy when it's time to prepare for interviews and help your think about ideas for writing helpful blog post.

Google is your best friend in your learning journey, and you have to constantly google things to learn and understand them. As you are searching, make note of the things where you haven't found a good resource for. Those are great candidates for writing helpful blog posts. When you think you have an idea for a blog post or enough content, discuss with me and I’ll try help guide you in writing your post. If you are intersted in getting more visibility for your post, we can discuss editing your blog post and cross-posting it on the MLmentorship blog. This will give your work visibility. You’ll also also learn how to work with github, submit a PR request, and contribute to another repository. You’ll be building your portfolio along the way which helps your job search. Let’s aim for everyone writing at least 1 blog-post in the first 2 months. I’ll help you edit and will cross-post on [MLmentoship blog](http://mlmentorship.github.io) to further promote your work.

### Stream 1 (Starting out in ML)

This stream is suitable for participant that do not have any ML experience and are interested in a curriculum for self-learning. The following curriculum along with a support group of peers going through the same journey will prepare participants for stream two.

You don’t need to know everything about everything. At the beginning, focus on learning a few things really well.

- Machine learning basics: how to formulate a machine learning problem
    + [Introduction](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html), and [Chapter 5](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html) of the deep learning book 
        + *Note*: if you need a refresher on [Linear Algebra](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html),  [probability theory](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html), and [numerical computation](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html), chapters 2-4 in the deep learning book are a great resource. 
    + [optional] [Chapter 1](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) of Hands-on machine learning book
- Learn theory of 5 basic algorithms, how to evaluate them and how to use them in practice (sklearn):
    - regression:
        - Linear regression 
    - Clustering:
        - K-means clustering
    - classification:
        - logistic regression
        - SVMs
        - Random forests
- Model evaluation
    - Cross-validation, over-fitting, 
    - accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, ROC curve, loss functions
- Project 1 [Kaggle]
    - study problem formulation
    - follow others' solutions with various algorithms
    - replicate existing solutions and understand various aspects of data preparation and modelling

### Stream 2 (Getting first ML job)
In stream two, the most important thing for job seekers is obtaining experience in doing projects that would be similar to what a Data scientist/ML engineer will do on the job. This will be achieved through doing multiple individual projects to gain experience with various data modalities and algorithms. The capstone group projects' goal is to simulate the actual work that you'll do as a data scientist/ML engineer in your actual job.
- Intermediate ML algorithms
    - more sophisticated classifiers and clustering algorithms
    - neural networks
- Project 2 [Kaggle]
    - replicate others existing solutions
    - provide 1 additional solution to the problem
- Project 3 [Kaggle]
    - replicate others existing solutions
    - provide 1 additional solution to the problem
- Project 4 [Capstone group project]
    - ML problem formulation
    - data collection / preparation
    - modelling
    - team work

- Interview prep

### Stream 3 ( ML Career progress)
This stream is mostly relevant to people that are currently in a ML/DS role and are seeking ways to advance their technical careers. This can be achieved by learning more advanced ML topics, replicating state of the art machine learning papers, and building on top of these works to make new contribution to the field.  
- Advanced ML topics
    - learn basics of a sub-field (e.g. NLP)
- Advanced project 1 [replicating a paper from github code]
    - replicate the building of baselines methodologies
    - replicate the papers' proposed method and understand insights, details of implementation, and the pros and cons.
- Advanced project 2 [build on top of project Advanced project 1]
    - read and review relevant literature
    - list a set of ideas to improve upon the paper from advanced project 1
    - design a set of experiments
    - implement and experiment with a subset ideas
    - write up the project in the form of a conference paper

- Interview prep




## FAQ

- What programming language should we start with?
    - I suggest python. It's the de facto language in the industry and unless you have a very strong opinion about another programming language, I suggest everyone start with python so that group projects are done easier. 
- How many projects do we need to do to get a job?
    - It's hard to put a number on such a thing because everyone learns differently. However, if I were forced to pick a number, I'd say 4 projects. 3 strong individual [kaggle-like](https://www.kaggle.com/) projects and 1 larger-scale group project that's more similar to the actual work happening in the industry. 
- Where do we get data?
    - Kaggle is a good candidate for individual projects, but I suggest going beyond that in the group project and source data by e.g. scarping the web or alternative data sources.
- Should we use jupyter notebooks?
    - [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are a great tool to use for doing data science and ML projects since you can write your explanations, code, and results in the same doc. You'll also get the benefit of easily converting your work to a blog post by converting a jupyter notebook to [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- How do we prepare for interviews?
    - I will introduce resources, and you can form sub-groups for mock-interview preparation when it comes the time to do that.
